<h2>Project 0</h2>
Done to ensure the environment and needed libraries were properly installed on our devices, this project features some of the basic features of the vPython library, simulating a ball bouncing in a box. We were later told to experiment ourselves, at which point I added a second ball, that does not stay within the bounds of the box at all times.

<h2>Project 1</h2>
In this project we explored collision, looking at both elastic and inelastic collision, as well as the simulating the effects of gravity. The simulations concern looking at the effects of gravity on a falling object,

<h2>Project 2</h2>
This project looked at rotational and gravitational physics, requiring us to simulate the orbital paths of the inner solar system, including accurately calculating inner celesitial body forces on one another.

<h2>Project 3</h2>
This project worked with springs, and simulated the differences in system potential energy versus kinetic energy with the Forward Euler, Backward Euler, and Trapezoid methods. It also looked at the differences in undamped versus damped springs.

<h2>Project 4</h2>
This project worked with generating randomness and validating it, as well as using current or previous states to determine next states, using known algorithms such as the ones used to develop cellular autonoma and Conway's Game of life.

<h2>Project 5</h2>
This project required a simulation of different logic gate combinations, updating with proper gate delay, using self build gate and node classes in order to create a path the input and change values in. Nand, Nor, and Not were the gates required to properly complete this project. This was done by first simulating the inputs and observing the ouputs of a singular gate, then creating a 2 gate level path where 2 of the same gate lead into a third gate. Lastly a D-latch was simulated.

<h2>Project 6</h2>
This project required a simulation of an RC Filter circuit, as well as a Half Wave Recitifier. This simulation was strictly equation based and was hard coded for the most accuracy in the output. The validation was done by creating the same circuit in LTSpice, and getting an output Voltage waveform at multiple nodes

<h2>Project 7</h2>
This project was a pick you own project that required taking a further step in one of the previously touched on topics, or combining them. I combined the random aspects of project 3 with the collision aspects of project 1, to properly simulate a worst case scenario of 9 ball pool and bumper pool, to observe how many turns it would take to complete the games if the balls were hit at absolute random. I also properly implemented friction acting on the balls as they rolled across the table, so that all balls would come to a stop before the next ball was hit.
